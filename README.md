# Foosball Elo Ranking App

>“Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be done!
There are points to be scored. There are games to be won.
And the magical things you can do with that ball
will make you the winning-est winner of all.
Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can be,
with the whole wide world watching you win on TV.
Except when they don't
Because, sometimes they won't.
I'm afraid that some times
you'll play lonely games too.
Games you can't win
'cause you'll play against you.”

― Dr. Seuss, Oh, The Places You'll Go!

>“Take someone who doesn't keep score,
who's not looking to be richer, or afraid of losing,
who has not the slightest interest even
in his own personality: he's free.”

― Rumi

>Shut up, Rumi.

>The question is not whether we are able to change but whether we are changing fast enough.

## Summary

This Rails app applies the World Football Elo Ratings ranking system to games of foosball. Once properly implemented, players will be able to prove definitively who is the best at the game and, more importantly, who is the worst.

## The Elo

For a complete guide to Elo Ratings, visit [the Wikipedia page here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Football_Elo_Ratings), but the basic calculation is as follows:

>P = KG(W - We)

where:

P = points change
K = weight index (depending on the type of match, tournament, world cup, friendly)
G = a number based on the index of goal differences
W = the result of the match
We = the expected result of the match
